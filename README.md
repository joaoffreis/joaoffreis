# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm JoÃ£o

I'm a Mechanical Engineer turned Data Professional based in Basel, Switzerland. This GitHub serves as my portfolio, as well as a platform to share resources with the community (especially beginners). Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging data to solve real-world problems and eager to connect with others who share this interest.
